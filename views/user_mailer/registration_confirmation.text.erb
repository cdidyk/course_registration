Hello,

Thank you for registering for the <%= @registrant.event %>. I am certain it will exceed your expectations!

Here is the confirmed registration info:

Name: <%= @registrant.name %>
Email: <%= @registrant.email %>
Phone: <%= @registrant.phone %>

Courses:
<%- @registrant.courses.each do |course| %>
  - <%= course %>
<%- end %>

Amount Charged: <%= @amount_paid %>

If this doesn't look right to you, please send me an email (cdidyk@gmail.com) or call me (727.453.2490).

Grandmaster Wong will ensure that you have a great time in your course(s), but I want to make sure you have a great time in St. Petersburg, too. To that end, I'll be adding information on transportation, hotels, and restaurants to the website, but if I can help you further in that regard or if you have any other questions, please contact me. Email is usually best, but if I miss your phone call and you leave me a message, I will return your call promptly.

Enjoy the <%= @registrant.event %>!


Best wishes,
Chris
