          %p <strong>*Prerequisite for those who are learning from Shaolin Wahnam for the first time.</strong>
          %p This is both the most basic and most valuable course Sifu Wong teaches. If you have questions about whether chi is real or what chi flow is, they will be answered in the first five minutes through direct experience! And then Sifu Wong will teach you the valuable skills necessary to generate a chi flow yourself, so you can practice 15 minutes a day on your own to become healthier, happier, and more full of energy in your daily life than you can imagine. It truly has to be experienced to be believed.
          %p Generating Energy Flow showcases the best three exercises from the 18 Lohan Hands, a legendary set of exercises for restoring health, vitality, mental clarity, and longevity.
          %p Lifting the Sky, Carrying the Moon, and Pushing Mountains are all you need to have a wildly successful Chi Kung practice.  Learn to use these exercises to generate an energy flow and enjoy standing zen meditation at the end of each exercise.

          %p Learn to utilize your Chi Kung Exercises to generate a Cosmic Shower of cleansing energy to purify your mind, body and spirit.  Sifu Wong will directly transmit this precious and powerful skill during this course so you walk away with this incredible skill at your disposal.

          %p Cultivating the spirit, which is non-religious, is an important aspect of Wahnam training and involves emotional, mental as well as spiritual purification.  At the lowest level, spiritual cultivation enables us to be happy, peaceful and free of stress, while at the highest level it enables us to return to God, or by whatever name we call the Supreme Reality.

          %p Yang Style Tai Chi Chuan is the most popular style of Tai Chi Chuan practiced today. Indeed, it is so popular that to many people, Tai Chi Chuan means Yang Style Tai Chi Chuan, though Chen Style Tai Chi Chuan is also becoming popular today.

          %p Practitioners in China and other parts of the world often practice this set as a graceful exercise without internal force, and in solo without its combat application. But in our school, internal force training and combat application are essential aspects of this set and are taught at the courses.

          %p In Abdominal Breathing, energy (not air) flows in from the Cosmos down from the nose to the abdominal energy field along the Ren or Conceptual Meridian, and up from the abdominal energy field along the Ren Meridian out of the mouth back to the Cosmos.

          %p This technique is used to generate tremendous breath control and a deep zen state of mind to help the practitioner reach a powerful meditative state where she can reach satori and experience the beauty of the cosmos.

          %p This set, which is probably closer in spirit and form to the original Taijiquan practiced by past masters like Zhang San Feng and Chen Wang Ting than many Taijiquan sets practiced today, enables us to attain good health, combat efficiency and spiritual fulfillment.
          %p Chen style Tai Chi Chuan is often seen as the faster type of Tai Chi Chuan as a swifter flow of qi is emphasized.  Sifu Wong hopes practitioners of all styles will come and enjoy this variation of applying the skills he will be teaching throughout the courses to a beautiful set created by the Grandmaster himself.

          %p Sinew Metamorphosis is such a powerful exercise in our school that it is understandable that many people think we are exagerrating when we say by just flicking the fingers three times we can generate tremendous internal force or expand our spirit to merge with the cosmos!
          %p While these exercises are deceptively simple to perform the skill of megring with the cosmos that is transmitted by Sifu Wong during these exercises is of the highest level.
          %p This course will leave you completely amazed at the depth and power of the highest level Chi Kung skills.

The set is performed slowly here to enable students to learn it more easily. Do not worry about force while learning the set. Just get the routine correct. At the course the Form-Flow-Force method will be taught to perform the set with flowing chi and internal force.
          %p The Wudang Taijiquan we practice in our school contains all the important features for which Taijiquan is famous, like graceful, flowing movements, use of mind and internal force instead of physical strength, attaining good health, vitality and longevity, combat efficiency irrespective of size, age and gender, and spiritual cultivation irrespective of religion.

For instance, it is the same price to sign up for three Tai Chi Chuan as it is to sign up for four! We're doing this because each of these courses is a treasure, and this is probably the only time Grandmaster Wong will ever teach these Tai Chi Chuan courses in the United States!
